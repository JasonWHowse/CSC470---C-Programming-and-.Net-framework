# Project 2: A simple Employee-Pay Calculator (WPF Application)
Develop a WPF application that has a button to calculate an employee’s weekly pay,
given the number of hours worked. An employee should have a first name, last name,
age, and hourly consulting rate. You should be able to create an employee object and
provide the hours worked to calculate the weekly pay. The application assumes a
standard workweek of 40 hours. Any hours worked over 40 hours in a week are
considered overtime and earn time and a half. Salary for time and a half is calculated
by multiplying the employee’s hourly wage by 1.5 and multiplying the result of that
calculation by the number of overtime hours worked. This value is then added to the
user’s earnings for the regular 40 hours of work to calculate the total earnings for that
week.
